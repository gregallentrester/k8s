TOPIC  Docker Swarm v K8s Pod Docker
Swarm/Compose == K8s Pod

Networking
Kubernetes
Flat network (implemented typically as an overlay), allows all pods to interact.
Needs two CIDRs:  One for the services; One from which pods acquire an IP address.
Classless inter-domain routing CIDR - a system of routing IPv4 addresses.

Docker Swarm
Node joining a swarm cluster generates an overlay network for services that
span every host in the swarm and a host-only docker bridge network for containers.


TOPIC  KUBECTL
command:
kubectl config get-contexts

result:
CURRENT NAME                CLUSTER          AUTHINFO    NAMESPACE
*       docker-for-desktop  docker-for-desktop-cluster   docker-for-desktop

To Change:
kubectl config use-context docker-for-desktop

CGroups


TOPIC
A Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage
(CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes.
Docker relies on cgroups to control and isolate resource limits.
